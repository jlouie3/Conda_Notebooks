    "            -A Priori Probabilities\n",
    "                -Can be dervided by reason alone, before anything specific about data is known\n",
    "                -Ex: There are more positive movie reviews than negative movie reviews in a dataset\n",
    "            -Conditional probabilities\n",
    "                -Ex 1: The word 'worst' appears in two negative movie reviews an 0 times in positive movie reviews\n",

    "            -How to works:\n",
    "                -Uses Bayes Theorem to calculate if sample is more likely to be positive or negative\n",
    "                -Classify sample as whatever it is more likely to be\n",
    "        SVM\n",
